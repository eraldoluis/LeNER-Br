# LeNER-Br
[LeNER-Br: a Dataset for Named Entity Recognition in Brazilian Legal Text](https://cic.unb.br/~teodecampos/LeNER-Br/) 
  is a project developed as a collaboration between two institutions of the [University of Brasília](http://unb.br/):
    [NEXT (Núcleo de P&D para Excelência e Transformação do Setor Público)](http://next.unb.br/)
    and [CiC (Departamento de Ciência da Computação)](http://www.cic.unb.br/).

This repository was forked from the original code to add per-entity evaluation.
The original code included only per-token evaluation which is unusual for NER.
More information can be found in the [original work page](https://cic.unb.br/~teodecampos/LeNER-Br/).
